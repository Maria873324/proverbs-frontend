# 🌿 Proverbs Frontend App
This is the frontend of the Proverbs App, a simple full-stack web application that allows users to view, filter, add, update, and delete proverbs.
It connects to a backend API built with Express.js and stores data in a JSON file.

✅ The backend is deployed on Render, and the frontend will be deployed on Render as well.

---

## 📌 Project Description

This project presents a clean and interactive user interface for managing proverbs stored on a remote server. Users can:

- View all proverbs
- Filter proverbs by category
- Add new proverbs
- Edit existing ones

The app communicates with a RESTful API using **AXIOS** and dynamically updates the DOM based on user interactions.
